== Description ==
The scienation plugin turns a wordpress installation into a tool for scientific publishing. That way every scientist can have his own "journal". It adds the necessary semantic annotations on the content and enables additional features like peer review. It can be combined with bibliographic reference managers. 

It provides integration with Figshare, automatic submission to arXiv and other useful features.

Every semantically-enabled scientific publication is parsed by scienation.com and works towards each scientist's personal impact score.
