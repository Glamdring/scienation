== Description ==
The scienation plugin turns a wordpress installation into a tool for scientific publishing. That way every scientist can have his own "journal". It adds the necessary semantic annotations on the content and enables additional features:

- adding an abstract to an article
- specifying authors using ORCID
- specifying science branches and publication type
- inserting references to DOI articles (as links, rather than the old-fashioned bibliography formats)
- providing peer review through the comments
- downloading an article as PDF

The plugin can be used by researchers for their personal websites/blogs, or by libraries that provide personal space for researchers to publish their materials.
